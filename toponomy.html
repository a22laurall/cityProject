    <h2>The legend of Hercules and Geryon</h2>
    <p>One of the best known myths related to the origin of the name of A Coru単a is the legend of Hercules and Geryon. Although there are many legends that revolve around the construction of the Tower of Hercules, there is one that everyone from A Coru単a knows: that of Hercules himself.
        It is a legend invented by King Alfonso X in his work 'Estoria de Espanna'. In it, this monarch tells that a giant, known as Geryon, king of Brigantium, forced his subjects to give him half of their possessions, including their children. Tired of the conditions imposed by the giant, they requested the help of Hercules, who challenged him to fight in a battle.
        The battle ended with the victory of Hercules. The so-called hero cut off the giant's head and buried it by the sea and on it, to commemorate his victory, he built a tower - the well-known Tower of Hercules - with a large torch on top.
        Next, according to legend, Hercules ordered the occupation of the town near this monument. It is also said that the first inhabitant to arrive is a woman called Cru単a, from whose name A Coru単a derives.</p>
