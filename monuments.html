    <h2>Obelisco</h2>
    <p>The Obelisk of A Coruña is a monument located in the Cantón Grande built in 1895. At the top of the monolith, a clock with four spheres tells the time and a weather vane indicates the direction of the wind. The clock has four dials and initially two of them gave the time in A Coruña and the other two in Madrid, reflecting the almost 20-minute solar time difference between the two cities.</p><br>
    <p>The story tells that the Obelisco of the Plaza de la Concordia in Paris dedicated to Ramses II, was passing through A Coruña when the ship that transported the immense monolith from Egypt to France, because it made a stopover of 15 days in our city. The people of A Coruña liked this monument so much that they decided to make a similar one to honor the deputy and minister Aureliano Linares Rivas, although smaller and with a clock where you can check the time.</p><br>
    <p>In 1952 this monolith was increased in height by decision of Mayor Alfonso Molina, since the buildings in the area grew in height and the monument remained small, losing prominence.</p><br>
